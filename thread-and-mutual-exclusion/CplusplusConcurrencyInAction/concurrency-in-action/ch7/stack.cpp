// Listing 7.4

// The reference-counted reclamation machinery
// This works reasonably well in low-load situations, where there are sutiable
// quiescent points at which no threads are in pop(). In high-load situaions,
// there may never be such a quiescent state. Under such a scenario, the
// to_be_deleted list would grow without bounds, and you'd be essentailly
// leaking memory again. If there aren't going to be any quiescent periods,
// you need to find an alternative mechanism for reclaming the nodes. The key
// is to identify when no more threads are accesing a particular node so that 
// it can reclaimed. By far the easiest such mechanism to reason about is the
// use of hazard ponters.
