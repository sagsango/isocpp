# libav

Fork because of war. Still highly compatible.

History of the fork: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libav#History

libav is going to die now that Debian switched back to FFmpeg in 2015?

`libav***` are libraries present inside of FFmpeg.

Each of those libraries can be versioned separately through the `version.h` header.
