# Utility libraries

Utility libraries built on top of OpenGL.

## GLU

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Utility_Library>

Functions prefixed with `glu`

Mesa implements it apparently, e.g. `dpkg` shows `libglu1-mesa`.

## GLEW

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Extension_Wrangler_Library>

## GLM

C++ Mathematics useful for OpenGL.

## SOIL

C image to textures.

## OGRE

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGRE>

OpenGL wrapper.

Not a full game engine.

Supports multiple backends, including Direct3D as well, possibly giving more portability / performance.

Even if you forget portability, it makes it easier to use OpenGL with some more convenient primitives. E.g.:

- it can draw a sphere: <http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/1.9/class_ogre_1_1_sphere.html>
