Free:

- `glmark2`. Maintained by Linaro. TODO how is the score calculated? <https://github.com/glmark2/glmark2/issues/31>

Non free:

- GFXBench: <https://gfxbench.com/result.jsp> By a company called Koshonti. You can run it for free on most devices, but they license the source (and TODO more complete versions?) to companies as a business model.
