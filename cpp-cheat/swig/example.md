# Example

We are going to generate and use a Python and Java API from a single annotated C source code. Note how DRY this is.

The best place to find simple examples like this are the language specific sections of the documentation: <http://www.swig.org/Doc2.0/Sections.html#Sections>

If something fails, first get a minimal example of C native interface on the respective language to ensure you have all setup well.
