/*
# deque

    Double ended queue.

    Random access.

    Very similar interface to std::vector, except that:

    - insertion to front is O(1)
    - there is no guarantee of inner storage contiguity

    Discussion on when to use deque or std::vector:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5345152/why-would-i-prefer-using-vector-to-deque

    It is controversial if one should use deque or std::vector as the main generic container.
