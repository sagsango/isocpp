-   <http://c-faq.com/index.html>

    Good straight to the point faq, covers specially confusing points

-   <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards>

    Official directory containing the latest free draft versions of the ANSI c specs

    The latest is: <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf>

    The closest to the ANSI standard that you can get for free (it is a paid standard...)

    This should be quite close to the actual specifications

    Quite readable, and fun to find obscure features which you had never heard of before!
