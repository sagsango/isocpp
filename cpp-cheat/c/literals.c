/*
# Literals

    *Literals* are values that can be expressed through a single
    language dedicated built-in syntax:

    - int:    `1`
    - long:   `1L`
    - float:  `1.0f`
    - double: `1.0`and their
    - char:   `'a'`
    - string: `"abc"`

    Some base types do not have specific literals: e.g. `short`.

    C99 introduces compound literals,
    which allow creation of literals for user defined types:

    - arrays
    - structs
    - unions
